# Entity Relationship Builder - Specifications

## Overview
The Entity Relationship Builder is a web-based application that allows users to create, visualize, and manage entity-relationship diagrams through an interactive graphical interface. Users can define entities with attributes, establish relationships between them, and export the resulting scene graph.

## Architecture
The application follows a client-side architecture built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring:
- Split-panel layout with visualization canvas and control panels
- Real-time visual feedback and interactive elements
- In-memory data management with export capabilities

## Component Specifications

### Core Components
- [Application Architecture](./specs/architecture.md) - Overall structure and technical implementation
- [User Interface](./specs/user-interface.md) - Layout, styling, and visual design
- [Entity Management](./specs/entity-management.md) - Entity creation, editing, and lifecycle
- [Relationship Management](./specs/relationship-management.md) - Relationship creation and management
- [Visualization System](./specs/visualization.md) - Canvas rendering and interactive elements
- [Export System](./specs/export-system.md) - Scene graph export and data serialization

### Key Features
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag-and-drop entity positioning with real-time relationship visualization
- **Entity Builder**: Dynamic entity creation with customizable names, attributes, and visual properties
- **Relationship Editor**: Intuitive relationship creation between entities with labeled connections
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization between data models and visual representation
- **Export Capabilities**: Scene graph export and clipboard integration

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Graphics**: SVG for relationship visualization
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design principles
- **Data Management**: In-memory JavaScript objects and arrays

## Usage Scenarios
1. **Entity Creation**: Users define entities with names and attributes
2. **Relationship Modeling**: Users establish labeled relationships between entities
3. **Visual Arrangement**: Users position entities on canvas through drag-and-drop
4. **Data Export**: Users export the complete scene graph for external use

## Future Extensibility
The modular design allows for future enhancements such as:
- Persistence layers (local storage, databases)
- Additional entity types and relationship properties
- Import functionality for existing scene graphs
- Advanced visualization options and themes
